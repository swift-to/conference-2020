# Swift Conference 2019

Most copy can be editing at the top of the page in [`Public_src/views/layout.pug`](https://github.com/bitwit/swift-conference-2019/edit/master/Public_src/views/layout.pug)

I'm trying to keep most text in variables there so we dont have to go deeper into the pug/html to change key info
