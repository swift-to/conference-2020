Currently working as a senior iOS developer on a fraud prevention framework, Abbey is one of a growing number of self-taught adult career changers. After a decade of working with kids as a nanny she attended an 8 week bootcamp and launched a new career as an iOS developer. Through her experience she has worked on a number of apps as well as frameworks and has been lucky to be part of the project and feature planning processes in her current position as well as previously while working on Intelâ€™s (now defunct) Vaunt AR Glasses. She specializes in mentoring new developers, leading feature teams, architecting mobile products, and designing simple solutions for previously complex situations and she hopes to share some of her experience with you.
