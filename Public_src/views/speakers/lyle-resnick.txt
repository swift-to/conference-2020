Lyle has over 30 years experience as a software developer and team lead. He has been developing iOS and Android software for the last 8 years.
Lyle thinks code quality is extremely important, as it is integral to the ability of a team to make future changes to an app. 
Experience has shown him that patterns created at the beginning of a project, whether good or bad, tend to be repeated for the lifetime of the app. 
For this reason, he prefers to use a solid architecture right from the start.

Over the last 5 years he has extensively studied and implemented mobile apps using architectures like MVVM, BLOC, MVP, and VIPER. 
His experience shows him that using a comprehensive architecture is the best way to develop an App that its bug free, testable and extensible.

When he's not thinking about mobile architecture, you will find him cycling, windsurfing or skiing.
