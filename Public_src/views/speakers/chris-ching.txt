Chris was a senior app developer at a software consulting company, building apps for multi-billion dollar clients.

He started a blog and YouTube channel for fun and little did he know that it would become his full time job 8 months later.

Since 2013, he's been teaching non-coders how to start building iOS apps through his YouTube channel and website, CodeWithChris.

Chris is a firm believer that putting yourself out there can yield unexpected outcomes and every developer should get involved with the community because you never know just what might happen...
